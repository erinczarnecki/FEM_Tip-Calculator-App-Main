## My process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I Learned

This project was a good exercise to practice estimating display placements for elements. When developing web pages, you will often need to use you best judgement to replecate mockups provided by UX team.  I spent a lot of time tweaking margins, widths, padding, etc trying to match the mockup as closely as possible. If I were to start this project again, I wouldn't be as concerned with matching the mockup exactly. Spending a lot of time on designs adjustment that don't impact the overall design or function of the website isn't the best practice.  
  
  
  

### Continued Development

As I go forward, I will continue to practice with the display attributes to improve the speed of production as well as my ability to estimate sizes.
